    "##  Loading the data into the data frame\n",
    "Loading the data into the pandas data frame is certainly one of the most important steps in EDA, as we can see that the value from the data set is comma-separated. So all we have to do is to just read the CSV into a data frame and pandas data frame does the job for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get or load the dataset into the notebook, all I did was one trivial step. In Google Colab at the left-hand side of the notebook, you will find a > (greater than symbol). When you click that you will find a tab with three options, you just have to select Files. Then you can easily upload your file with the help of the Upload option. No need to mount to the google drive or use any specific libraries just upload the data set and your job is done. One thing to remember in this step is that uploaded files will get deleted when this runtime is recycled. This is how I got the data set into the notebook."
